# Changelog

Since we follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits),
we're able to automatically create formal "releases" of the website
based on our commit messages. Releases in the context of websites are
simply snapshots in time of the website content. We use
[Commitizen](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-commitizen)
to automatically create these releases using
[SemVer](https://semverdoc.org) as the version numbering scheme.

Because releases are created based on commit messages, a new release is
created quite often---sometimes several times in a day. This also means
that any individual release will not have many changes within it. Below
is a list of the releases we've made so far, along with what was changed
within each release.
