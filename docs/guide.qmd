This guide provides an overview of how to use this template for creating
a new website. It includes instructions for using the template and
post-creation tasks.

## Installing

In order to use this template, you need to install a few programs:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/): Required by the template tool
    itself (copier).
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/): For version control and setting up Git
    to track the newly created data package.
-   [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#quick-start): A
    template tool for making new projects in a standardised and
    structured way.
-   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): A tool for managing Python
    environments and running commands. Some post-copy steps of this
    template use uv.
-   [just](https://just.systems/man/en/): A build management tool that
    helps with running common build and check tasks.

You will need to install Python and Git yourself, but the other tools
can be installed using
[`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)---which we strongly
recommend---with the following command:

``` bash
pipx install copier uv rust-just
```

## Creating a new website

You can use this template to create a new website with a standard set of
files and folders, as well as all the features and configurations to
make it easier to build your website smoothly and effectively. First,
open a Terminal and move into the directory where you want to create the
new website. Then run the following command:

``` bash
# Copy into the current directory, which is the "."
uvx copier copy --trust gh:seedcase-project/template-website .
```

::: callout-caution
This template runs some post-copy commands using your terminal. In order
to run them, you need to use the `--trust` option. Review the
[`copier.yml`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/template-website/blob/main/copier.yaml)
file, under the `_tasks` key to see what commands will be run after
copying the template, so you can know and trust what the commands are
doing. Unfortunately, this template can't be used without the `--trust`
option.

## Applying the template to an existing website

If you want to use this template on an existing website, you can use the
`copy` command of `copier` just like above to apply the template to the
existing website. This will add all the template's files and
configurations to the existing website.

``` bash
uvx copier copy --trust gh:seedcase-project/template-website .
```

It will go through a series of prompts, as in the case of creating a new
website, including asking if you want to overwrite existing files.

::: callout-note
To use the `copy` command, the website needs to be tracked by Git and in
a clean state (no changes).
:::

## Applying the latest template changes

There are two ways to update an existing website with the latest changes
from the template: `update` and `recopy`.

Use `update` to apply template updates to your project without
overwriting local changes. `update` will compare the version of the
template you used when you first copied the template with the current
version of the template, and then apply the changes that are different.
This also means it won't overwrite any changes you made to files in your
current website, for example, if you deleted a file that was in the
template, it won't be copied back.

Use `recopy` if you want to reapply the template from scratch, which
will overwrite any changes you made to the files that were copied from
the template. This is useful if you want to reset the website to the
state of the template. For example, if you deleted a file but want it
back from the template or are simply curious to see if there are any new
changes that you might want to use.

In both cases, the commands are very similar and also use many of the
same options as the `copy` command. If you want to use the same answers
as given when you first copied the template, you can use the
`--defaults` option. Then it will only prompt you for the questions that
have changed since the last time you copied the template.

``` bash
uvx copier update --trust --defaults
# Or
uvx copier recopy --trust --defaults
```

As with the `copy` command, the website needs to be tracked by Git and
must be in a clean state (no changes) for the `update` and `recopy`
commands to work.

## Post-creation setup

These steps are mainly for us in the Seedcase Project to set up the
repository with the settings we use, but you can follow them if you want
to set up your website in a similar way. They are also included in a
message after you've copied the template.

After copying the template, while in the directory of the new website,
run the following:

``` bash
just install-precommit
```

This sets up the pre-commit hooks to run standard checks on your
repository whenever you commit files to the history.

If you are using the template to create a website for the Seedcase
Project, run:

``` bash
just update-quarto-theme
```

This adds the `seedcase-theme` Quarto theme to the website, which
provides a consistent look and feel across all Seedcase Project
websites. It's called `update-quarto-theme` here since you can use this
command to keep the theme updated.

Next, install [`spaid`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/spaid) and
use the following commands to run the next setup steps:

``` bash
spaid_gh_create_repo_from_local -h
spaid_gh_set_repo_settings -h
spaid_gh_ruleset_basic_protect_main -h
```

Some configuration is needed after copying this template to a new
repository, including configuration external to the repository. Some
GitHub workflows require installing GitHub Apps, for greater security
purposes and easier administration when managing multiple repositories.
The [security
section](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/operations/security#using-github-apps-to-generate-tokens)
in our [Guidebook](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/) provides
instructions on how to set up GitHub Apps, secrets, and variables.
Ideally the secrets and variables should be set up in the organization
settings. The specific workflows in this template that require this
additional setup are:

-   The workflow `.github/workflows/release-package.yml` requires the
    [auto-release-token](https://github.com/apps/auto-release-token)
    GitHub App as well as a creating a GitHub secret called
    `UPDATE_VERSION_TOKEN` and a variable called `UPDATE_VERSION_APP_ID`
    that has the App ID.
-   The workflow `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml` requires the
    [add-to-board-token](https://github.com/apps/add-to-board-token)
    GitHub App, along with the `ADD_TO_BOARD_TOKEN` secret and the
    `ADD_TO_BOARD_APP_ID` variable of the GitHub App's ID.
